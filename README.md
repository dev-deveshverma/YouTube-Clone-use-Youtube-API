 YouTube provides a simple way for people to store videos online and share them with others. YouTube videos cover any topic anyone cares to upload a video about. These videos are easy to share via other forms of social media, email and websites and can also be embedded in other websites.
## About
 Students love to watch videos on YouTube which not only helps them learn complex concepts but also helps them improve listening and punctuation skills. On another hand, teachers can focus more on students' learning abilities instead of spending more time explaining complex concepts and topics.

## Introduction
Our task was to implement our HTML, CSS, Advanced JavaScript google Api etc  knowledge which we had learned at Masai. We used this skillset to build a static copy of Google_Translater applicaton along with the responsiveness of the page for different screen sizes and some user interactivity with Advanced JS.
